# HOUSING ADVANCED REGRESSION DATASET — PROJECT OVERVIEW

## **The HOUSING ADVANCED REGRESSION DATASET presents a BIG DATA PROBLEM, consisting of 81 INPUT FEATURES (COLUMNS) and approximately 1,400 ROWS. This high-dimensional dataset is subject to the CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY, making effective FEATURE SELECTION and REDUCTION essential for successful REGRESSION MODELING.**

***To address this, the following WORKFLOW was implemented to optimize PERFORMANCE and ensure ROBUST PREDICTIVE POWER.***

## WORKFLOW
### STEP 1: CHECK DUPLICATE COLUMNS
#### IDENTIFY and REMOVE DUPLICATE COLUMNS, a common issue in datasets with a large number of FEATURES.

### STEP 2: MISSING VALUE IMPUTATION
#### DROP COLUMNS with MISSING VALUES ≥ 50%.

#### IMPUTE NUMERICAL FEATURES with their MEAN VALUE.

#### IMPUTE CATEGORICAL FEATURES with their MOST FREQUENT VALUE.

### STEP 3: CHI-SQUARE TEST
#### Utilize the CHI-SQUARE TEST to SELECT the BEST CATEGORICAL COLUMNS relevant to the TARGET variable.

### STEP 4: ANOVA TEST
#### Apply the ANOVA TEST to IDENTIFY and SELECT the MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMERICAL FEATURES.

### STEP 5: DATA TYPE CORRECTION
#### ENSURE all DATA TYPES are ACCURATE and CORRECTED for proper MODEL INPUT.

### STEP 6: CUSTOM ORDINAL ENCODING
#### Implement CUSTOM ORDINAL ENCODING for categorical columns:

#### Map each CATEGORY to a NUMERICAL VALUE (e.g., ‘YES’=1, ‘NO’=0, ‘OTHER’=2).

#### *Calculate the CORRELATION of these ENCODED VALUES with the TARGET VARIABLE.*

#### Select the best ENCODING approach per feature based on correlation strength.

### STEP 7: OUTLIER HANDLING & DISTRIBUTION VISUALIZATION
#### DETECT and HANDLE OUTLIERS to minimize their IMPACT on MODELING.

#### *VISUALIZE FEATURE DISTRIBUTIONS for better INSIGHT and FEATURE ENGINEERING.*

### STEP 8: MODEL TRAINING
#### Train and COMPARE the following REGRESSION MODELS:

#### **LINEAR REGRESSION**

#### **RANDOM FOREST**

#### **GRADIENT BOOSTING**

#### **XGBOOST**

### STEP 9: MODEL ENSEMBLING
#### GROUP top MODELS using ADVANCED ENSEMBLING TECHNIQUES:

#### **VOTING ENSEMBLE**

#### **STACKING ENSEMBLE**

## SUMMARY
### This Workflow systematically addresses the CHALLENGES OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL REGRESSION problems—optimizing DATA PREPARATION, FEATURE SELECTION, ENCODING, OUTLIER HANDLING, MODEL SELECTION, and ADVANCED ENSEMBLING for maximum PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE.
